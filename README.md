🌌 About Me

“In cybersecurity, every log tells a story. I’m here to read and rewrite them.”

I’m a final-year CS student at Al Akhawayn University, driven by a passion for cyber defense, network security, and SOC operations. My mission is to build resilient systems and outsmart attackers with automation and innovation.

🛠️ Currently crafting:  
A SOC lab with ELK Stack and Suricata for real-time threat detection  
LogHunter: A Hadoop-powered anomaly detection engine  
Digital Energy ID: OCR + biometric authentication for secure access


🔐 Learning journey: Preparing for Security+, exploring malware traffic analysis, and diving into side-channel attacks  
💡 Tools in action: Wireshark, Zeek, OpenVAS, Docker, and more
