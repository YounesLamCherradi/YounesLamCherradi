🔒 Who Am I?

“Every packet holds a secret. I’m here to decode them.”

A final-year CS student at Al Akhawayn University, I’m fueled by a passion for cyber defense, network security, and SOC operations. My goal? Outsmart attackers with automation, visibility, and cutting-edge tools.

🛠️ Crafting in my lab:  
SOC-Lite: A real-time threat detection lab with ELK and Suricata  
LogHunter: Hadoop-driven log anomaly detection engine  
Digital Energy ID: Secure OCR + biometric authentication system


🔍 On my radar: Preparing for Security+, mastering malware traffic analysis, and exploring cache-timing attacks  
⚙️ Powered by: Wireshark, Zeek, OpenVAS, Docker, and a relentless curiosity
